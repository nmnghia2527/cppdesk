CppDesk is a zero-install remote desktop application for Windows distributed as a single portable executable (**`CppDesk.exe`**). It works out of the box with no configuration or external dependencies required. You have full control of your connection and data, with end-to-end encrypted sessions.

Connect across networks using a **9-Digit Desk ID** (`XXX XXX XXX`) with a permanent password or interactive approval.

---

## Features

- **Screen Sharing**: Smooth, low-latency remote desktop streaming with multi-monitor switching, borderless fullscreen, and adjustable quality settings.
- **Display Matching**: Fit remote displays to eliminate black bars, or dynamically adapt the remote computer's resolution to match your local window.
- **Multi-Session Tabs**: Manage multiple simultaneous connections in clean browser-style tabs with live status indicators, unread chat counters, and fast keyboard shortcuts.
- **File & Folder Transfer**: Drag and drop files and complete folders directly onto the remote screen with real-time transfer tracking and integrity verification.
- **Voice Intercom & Audio**: Stream host system audio and talk back with real-time two-way voice communication and instant mute controls.
- **Session Recording**: Record remote sessions directly to seekable video files with one click.
- **Privacy Mode**: Blank out the remote screen and block local keyboard and mouse input while you work securely.
- **TCP Port Forwarding**: Access remote services securely through local ports with quick presets for Remote Desktop (RDP), SSH, Web, and VNC.
- **Remote Terminal**: Built-in command prompt and PowerShell console accessible directly from the side drawer for quick administrative tasks.
- **Screen Whiteboard**: Draw and annotate together in real time using pens, highlighters, arrows, and laser pointers.
- **Address Book**: Save and organize frequent computers with custom names, category tags, and instant search.
- **End-to-End Security**: Protected with encrypted handshakes, authenticated stream encryption, brute-force lockout protection, and security code verification.
- **Automatic Updates**: Built-in update notifications keeping your client secure and synchronized with new releases.
